                our servers automatically collect when you access or use our
                Services and which we record in log files. Depending on how you

                device information, browser type, and settings and information
                about your activity in the Services (such as the date/time

                data may include information such as your IP address (or proxy
                server), device and application identification numbers,
                location, browser type, hardware model, Internet service
                provider and/or mobile carrier, operating system, and system

              <li>
                <i>Location Data.</i> We collect location data such as
                information about your device's location, which can be either
                precise or imprecise. How much information we collect depends on
                the type and settings of the device you use to access the
                Services. For example, we may use GPS and other technologies to
                collect geolocation data that tells us your current location
                (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing us to
                collect this information either by refusing access to the
                information or by disabling your Location setting on your
                device. However, if you choose to opt out, you may not be able
                to use certain aspects of the Services.

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Consent.</strong> We may process your information if you
                have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal
                information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your

              <li>
                <strong>Legitimate Interests.</strong> We may process your
                information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to
                achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do
                not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms.
                For example, we may process your personal information for some
                of the purposes described in order to:

              <li>
                <strong>Legal Obligations.</strong> We may process your
                information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with
                our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law
                enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our

                would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the
                information and the collection is reasonable for purposes
                related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a

            <p>
              Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity
              to determine you are the same person about whom we have the
              information in our system. These verification efforts require us
              to ask you to provide information so that we can match it with
              information you have previously provided us. For instance,
              depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to
              provide certain information so that we can match the information
              you provide with the information we already have on file, or we
              may contact you through a communication method (e.g., phone or
              email) that you have previously provided to us. We may also use
              other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.
            </p>
            <p>
              We will only use personal information provided in your request to
              verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the
              extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information
              from you for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot
              verify your identity from the information already maintained by
              us, we may request that you provide additional information for the
              purposes of verifying your identity and for security or
              fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally
              provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.
